# Settings

Tix expects to find a file called `tix.yml` in the same directory as the markdown document provided. This settings
file contains information needed by tix in order to communicate with ticketing systems.

The following is the expected format of the settings file:
```yml
jira:
    no_epics: true|false
    url: https://url.to.your.jira.instance.com
    tickets: 
        // All fields should be lower case. Field name spaces should be included (ex- epic name)
        default:
            field: value // Fields to be added to any kind of jira issue
        epic:
            field: value // Fields to be added to epics
        issue:
            field: value // Fields to be added to issues
        task: 
            field: value // Fields to be added to tasks (sub-issues of issues)
variables:
    key: value
    envKey: $environment_variable_name
    // tix will parse the markdown document and replace each occurance of "key" with it's value (or environment variable
    // when a '$' preceeds the value)  
``` 

# Jira

Tix expects your jira account information to be stored in your environment. Specifically, it will look for the following
variables:  

- `JIRA_USERNAME`: This should be set to your Jira user name (typically an email address).
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN`: This should be set to your Jira api key. Those may be generated by following the instructions found
here: [Jira Api tokens](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html)
